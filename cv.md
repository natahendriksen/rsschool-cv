### About me
I am beginner Front-End Developer now living in Warsaw, Poland.
Making web pages gives me a lot of satisfaktion and joy. I very like this feeling when I open my project and everything works as I wanted.
Programming challenges me to make intellectual effort and is very developing.
I would like to find a job as junior Front-End Developer in near future.
